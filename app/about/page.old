                I am a dedicated full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience in software development. I have honed my skills in both front-end
                and back-end tkchnologies. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive solutions.
                <br />
                I believe in continuous learning and improvement as a way to make myself the best developer I can be. I also enjoy exploring the multiple
                facets of Linux, which I have been using for over 30 years as both a user and a system administrator for personal and professional projects.
                <br />
                When I'm not coding, you can find me biking, listening to music or sitting by the river with a rod and reel.
