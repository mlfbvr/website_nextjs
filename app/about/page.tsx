          I am a dedicated full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience
          in software development. I have honed my skills in both front-end and
          back-end technologies. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple,
          beautiful, and intuitive solutions.

          I believe in continuous learning and improvement as a way to make
          myself the best developer I can be. I also enjoy exploring the
          multiple facets of Linux, which I have been using for over 30 years as
          both a user and a system administrator for personal and professional
          projects.

          When I'm not coding, you can find me biking, listening to music or
          sitting by the river with a rod and reel.
